# Motivation & Concrete Problem Statement 

The problem statement is as follows: What will the stock price be in the future for a set portfolio? Stock market prediction and analysis are some of the most difficult jobs to complete. There are numerous causes for this, including market volatility and a variety of other dependent and independent variables that influence the value of a certain stock in the market. These variables make it difficult for any stock market expert to anticipate the rise and fall of the market with precision. Machine learning algorithms are widely used by many organizations in stock market prediction.
